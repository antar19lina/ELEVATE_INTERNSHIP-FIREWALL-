🔍 How a Firewall Filters Traffic
______________________________________________________________
A firewall works like a security gatekeeper 🚪 for your network:

✔️ Allows packets that match your security rules.

❌ Blocks packets that are unauthorized or suspicious.

Filters based on port numbers, IP addresses, and protocols.

By controlling inbound and outbound traffic, it protects systems from:
🛡 Unauthorized access
🐞 Malware communication
🚷 Network attacks
